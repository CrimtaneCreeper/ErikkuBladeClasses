Every creature within 100 ft of the swarm makes a constitution saving throw dc 18. On a failed save they are deafened and take 4d6 thunder damage. If a creature is silenced they do not have to make the save. 4) You create a sphere of antimagic centered on you, radius 20 ft, for 1 minute. You are immune to its effects, but everyone else is affected as normal. 5) A pigeon appears out of nowhere, for the next five minutes out of game, anything you may learn out of character can be used as legal knowledge for the duration as the pigeon will speak of the things you learn.
