You can have a maximum of 5 Blood Points in your Blood Pool at a time, this increases as you gain levels in this class. Your pool starts at 0 when you finish a long rest (or complete 4 short rests), this is because in order for the blood to be used it must be “Fresh Blood”, blood from a living creature or a corpse that has been dead for no longer than 4 hours, otherwise the blood dries or becomes impure. Whenever you use a Hemomancer feature that forces you to lose hit points, you can instead draw from this Blood Pool instead. Each blood point counts as 1 hit point. 1 ounce of blood is enough to fill 1 Blood Point into the Blood Pool. This blood must be “Fresh Blood” as described earlier. Alternatively, as an action you can take 1d4 + your Hemomancer level damage to fill your blood pool by an amount equal to half the amount of damage dealt (rounded down, minimum of 1).  As a bonus action on your turn, you can take blood from a vial, or other form of containment, and fill your blood pool by an amount as described above, emptying the vial or other form of containment. (Note a typical vial contains up to 4 ounces of liquid.) Once your blood pool is filled completely using one of the following methods, you cannot fill it again until you complete a short or long rest. When you drop a creature to 0 hit points, you gain an amount of Blood Points into your Blood Pool equal to their CR level. If their CR is anything below 1 but greater than 0, you gain 1 point. This feature does not apply to a creature that does not possess blood."

By doing so, you can create a single-handed simple weapon with a reach of 5ft if it’s a melee weapon, or a range of 80/240 if it’s a ranged weapon. The weapon has the finesse property, in addition you can alternatively use Wisdom for the attack and damage rolls for the weapon instead of Strength or Dexterity. The damage dealt by your blood weapons is necrotic damage. The damage die of the weapon is equal to the die you used to take damage. The weapons can last for up to 4 hours or until you stop holding/drop the weapon. They also require focus to use, as if you were concentrating on a spell. You can reforge your weapon, even if you have lost concentration on it, on your turn as a Bonus Action. Doing so will reroll the damage die you spent earlier and you take damage equal to the amount rolled.

Whenever you would take damage, as a reaction one of your tendrils can become a target for the attack, taking the damage for itself. When a tendril drops to 0 hit points it is destroyed. Each of these tendrils deals 1d10 necrotic damage and has a reach of 10 ft. When you take the attack action, you can forgo your weapon attack to instead attack with your Tendrils, making 1 attack for each tendril you have when you take the attack action. Your Bloody Tendrils count as simple weapons and use your wisdom modifier to hit but does not add it to damage rolls.

On a success the target takes 1 death fail, on a failure you take 1 death fail. When the target has 3 death fails, the soul is forced out, and your soul takes its place, with you making their body your own. You gain their statistics, but not their class features.
