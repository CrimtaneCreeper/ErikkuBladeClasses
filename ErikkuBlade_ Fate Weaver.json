This action counts as light activity.) Using a divination deck you perform a 10 minute ritual and call upon the voices of fate to guide you. When using a Divination Deck, ask a question. You can predict very vague messages through the divination deck, these messages can be forewarnings of upcoming events. These messages can be as vague as the DM desires. After the question is asked, roll the Divination Deck tool using Charisma. A roll of 9 or lower automatically fails, and the card you draw is blank. A roll of 10 or higher the roll is successful and you receive a vague answer to the question. The message appears on the blank card in a language of your choosing that you can read. The message can only be 50 words or less. The message remains visible on the card for up to 10 minutes, or until you dispel it. If you want a more specific answer to the question, ask the question again and roll once more. The DC is determined by the DM, however some questions cannot be answered by the deck, DM’s discretion.",

This action counts as light activity.) Using a divination deck you perform a 10 minute ritual and call upon the voices of fate to guide you. When using a Divination Deck, ask a question. You can predict very vague messages through the divination deck, these messages can be forewarnings of upcoming events. These messages can be as vague as the DM desires. After the question is asked, roll the Divination Deck tool using Charisma. A roll of 9 or lower automatically fails, and the card you draw is blank. A roll of 10 or higher the roll is successful and you receive a vague answer to the question. The message appears on the blank card in a language of your choosing that you can read. The message can only be 50 words or less. The message remains visible on the card for up to 10 minutes, or until you dispel it. If you want a more specific answer to the question, ask the question again and roll once more. The DC is determined by the DM, however some questions cannot be answered by the deck, DM’s discretion.",
