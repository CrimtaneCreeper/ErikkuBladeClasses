In addition, you gain resistance to psychic damage and as a bonus action you can establish a telepathic link to one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. This telepathic link allows you to communicate freely telepathically for up to twice the amount you could normally speak in the span of 6 seconds. ",
                "You are given two Warlock Spell Slots, see the Warlock’s “Pact Magic” feature PHB pg 107. Choose from two Eldritch Invocations (you must meet the prerequisites). You also gain the Eldritch Blast and one additional cantrip from the Warlock Spellcasting List. You also gain 4 spells from the Warlock Spellcasting List. These spells must be of a level of which you’d be able to cast as a 6th level Warlock.",
                "As you gain Dragon Shaman levels, or if you choose this Draconian Power at a later level, you can replace the spells you know with other spells from the same spellcasting list. In addition, you learn 1 warlock spell for each dragon shaman level above 6th. You gain additional Warlock Spell Slot at 11th level, and another one at 17th level. You also gain an additional Eldritch Invocation at these given levels.",

Your body might have a coating of viscous slime, tough hide, scales, perhaps you have an invisible barrier or any other weird aberrant things your sick mind can come up with. As a result, this gives you an increase to your armor class equal to half your Intelligence modifier. (Rounded down to a minimum of 1)"
